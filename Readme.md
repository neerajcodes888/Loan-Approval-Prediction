# Car Price Prediction using Machine Learning

![Car Price Prediction](car_price_prediction.png)

This repository contains a machine learning project that focuses on predicting car prices based on various features and attributes of the cars. The goal of this project is to develop a model that can accurately predict the price of a car given its characteristics, helping both buyers and sellers make informed decisions.

## Introduction

Predicting car prices is crucial in the automotive industry to assist customers in understanding the market value of a particular vehicle. This project utilizes machine learning techniques to create a predictive model for car prices. By training on a dataset containing various attributes of cars along with their prices, the model can learn patterns and relationships to make accurate predictions.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is sourced from [CarData](https://www.cardata.com/dataset), containing information about a wide range of cars, including features like mileage, brand, model year, engine size, and more.

The dataset consists of:
- **Features**: Various attributes of cars (e.g., brand, mileage, fuel type, etc.)
- **Target**: Car prices

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine: `git clone https://github.com/neerajcodes/car_price_predict.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd car_price_predict`
3. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended): `python -m venv venv`
4. Activate the virtual environment:
   - On Windows: `venv\Scripts\activate`
   - On macOS and Linux: `source venv/bin/activate`
5. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Usage

1. Make sure you have activated your virtual environment.
2. Prepare your dataset:
   - Download the dataset from [CarData](https://www.cardata.com/dataset) and save it in the project directory as `car_data.csv`.
3. Run the data preprocessing script: `python preprocess_data.py`
4. Train the model: `python train_model.py`
5. After training, you can use the trained model to make predictions by running: `python predict.py`

## Model

We are using a Random Forest regressor as the predictive model for this project. Random Forest is an ensemble learning method that combines multiple decision trees to make predictions. It is robust and handles non-linearity well, making it suitable for predicting car prices based on various features.

## Evaluation

The performance of the model is evaluated using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared (R2) score on a test dataset. These metrics provide insights into how well the model is generalizing to unseen data.
