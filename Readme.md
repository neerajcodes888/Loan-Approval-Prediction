# Loan Prediction ML

![Loan Prediction](loan_image1.png)

This repository contains Python scripts and Jupyter notebooks for loan prediction using machine learning. The goal of this project is to develop predictive models that can determine whether a loan application should be approved or not based on various features. The provided code helps in data preprocessing, model building, evaluation, and deployment of the loan prediction model.

## Introduction

Loan prediction is a common use case for machine learning in the finance industry. This repository offers a comprehensive set of tools and scripts to build, evaluate, and deploy machine learning models for loan prediction. Whether you're a data scientist, machine learning enthusiast, or a financial institution, these resources will help you understand and implement loan prediction models.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- Python 3.11.4 installed
- Required packages: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn

You can install the required packages using the following command:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
```

## Installation

To use this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/neerajcodes888/loan-prediction.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd loan_prediction
```

## Usage

To start using the loan prediction model, follow these steps:

1. Prepare your loan dataset in CSV format and place it in the `data` directory.

2. Open the Jupyter notebook `loan_prediction.ipynb` in the `notebooks` directory to build and evaluate the loan prediction model.

3. Run the provided Python scripts in the `scripts` directory for specific tasks, such as data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

## Notebooks

The `notebooks` directory contains a Jupyter notebook for building the loan prediction model:

- `loan_prediction.ipynb`: This notebook guides you through the entire process of loading data, preprocessing, model selection, training, evaluation, and deployment of the loan prediction model.

## Scripts

The `scripts` directory contains standalone Python scripts for various tasks:

- `loan_prediction.py`: Contains functions for cleaning and preprocessing loan data , Defines machine learning models, trains them on the data, and saves the trained model , Evaluates the trained model's performance using various metrics.
- `loan_approval_model`: The model for which loan prediction will work on!!!.
- `requirements.txt`: The required packages and libraries of python to deploy on Streamlit Platform.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you find any issues or want to enhance the loan prediction model, feel free to open a pull request. For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss the proposed changes.
